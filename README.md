Trend Report
============

This is a Lighthouse Labs final project built by Sandeep Samra and Natalie Famula. It is an application that scrapes certain blogs and websites and provides articles for different categories including food and fashion. We have implemented a background worker to scrape websites daily and provide new content for our app. A user can sign up for an account and save his or her favourite articles, and can share them on Twitter and Facebook. The purpose of this application is to allow a user to access articles related to a certain category without having to go to each individual blog or website.

Trend Report was built using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery.
